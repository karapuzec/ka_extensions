Requirements
==============
- Opencart 3.0.0.0 - 3.0.4.x


How to install
==============

The extension uses 'ocmod' technology introduced in Opencart 2. Installation steps are
similar to installation of any other 'ocmod' extension. They are described below.


1) Log in to the store back-end under your adminstrator account and upload the 'Ka Extensions' extension 
   archive at the 'Extension Installer' page.
   
2) Go to the 'Modifications' page and refresh the modifications cache. If everything is done correctly, 
   you should find the 'Ka Extensions' option in the drop-down select box at the 'Extensions' page.

3) Make sure that the store front-end is available for customers and it is functional.


Safe mode
